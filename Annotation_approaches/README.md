This folder contains example codes for annotation approaches (for YAKE_CosineTool)

The annotation procedure in this study is done with three approaches known as **FULL**, **LEAF** and **TOP**:
1.FULL: all 952 EO4GEO BoK concepts are considered for annotation within the PDF documents. 
2.LEAF: focuses on the bottom level of the EO4GEO BoK, i.e. concepts with no children (346 concepts).
3.TOP: involves annotating only with the top-level main concepts, i.e. the 14 EO4GEO BoK concepts that are direct children of the root node (i.e.”Geographic Information Science and Technology”). 

There are several purposes to use FULL, LEAF, and TOP approaches for the annotation , each contributing to a comprehensive assessment of the tools' performance.
