### geotec_thesis_EO4GEO
This repository is related to show all source codes which are created to Master thesis **'EO4GEO BOK ANNOTATION OF GI RESOURCES'**. 
The primary focus of this research project is to address the existing knowledge gap in automated methods for annotating resources with concepts derived from the [EO4GEO BoK](http://www.eo4geo.eu/bok/) To this aim, the overall goal of this is to (semi)-automate the process of annotating existing text-based resources with BoK concepts through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

This folder concisted all  codes and documents related to thesis works in master of geospatial technology
There are o5 main folders
1. Annotation_appraoches - This folder consisted with code examples for annotation approaches namely, FULL, LEAF and TOP
2. Data_processing - This folder consisted with tool for data cleaning and processing
3. Evaluation_matrix - this folder contains code example for evalaution (multi-class classification) with micro-averages
4. NLP_tools - This folder contains code eamples for 12 proposed NLP-based tools which are design and developed for annotation with EO4GEO BoK Concepts.
5. Website - This code contains all index, html and css files which are cretated for web application to present proposed NLP-based tools.
